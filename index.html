    <!-- AKA Awards -->
    <h2 align="center">AKA Accolades</h2>

    <div class="accolades">
      <p>
        AKA was an award-winning artist who was unapologettically himself, he
        strived to be the best at everything he did and always demanded the same
        from others whenever he worked with them. In 2002, Forbes, alongside his
        two friends Vice Versa and Greyhound, formed a hip hop group called
        Entity. The group received a nomination for a KORA Award in the Best
        African Hip Hop category. Entity disbanded in 2006 and Forbes went on to
        study sound engineering. In 2006, Forbes co-founded the production
        collective The I.V League alongside two other members. The I.V League
        made production credits for several artists, including Khuli Chana,
        ProKid and JR. In 2009, he released three singles: "In My Walk", "I Do",
        and "Mistakes". On 28 July 2010, Forbes released "I Want It All", which
        is the lead single from his debut studio album, Altar Ego. The album
        also pre-released two singles which were "All I Know" and "Victory Lap".
        "Victory Lap" was successful as it topped South African local radio
        charts. Alter Ego was then released on 23 August 2011. The album was
        certified gold by RiSA for its commercial success. The album won several
        accolades, including the 2011 Metro FM Awards for Best Hip Hop Album.
        Forbes won Best Male Artist of the Year at the 2012 South African Music
        Awards.
